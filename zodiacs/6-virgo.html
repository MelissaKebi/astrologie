          Virgo is a mutable, feminine earth sign, ruled by Mercury and
          associated with the Sixth House of work, health, and daily routines.
          Much like clay, the earthy mutability of Virgo is consistently
          adaptable. Virgo is known to be dependable—thanks to Virgo's attention
          to detail and perfectionist mindset. Although somewhat nervous, thanks
          to the restless Mercurial influence, Virgo tends to strive for the
          best outcome at all times. So, Virgo's critical nature is ideal for
          catching—then perfecting—every flaw. After all, nothing gets by the
          Virgin. And when lightning strikes, the volcanic nature of Virgo
          becomes electric!

        <p>
          On busy days like this it's easy to mindlessly snack on junk or not
          eat at all. Be prepared by packing a healthy lunch. Chicken breast or
          tuna on whole grain bread is easy to make and nutritious. Oh, and
          don't forget some fruit for that mid-afternoon sugar rush.

          After reading the back of a package of seeds, you may be even more
          confused than when you started your gardening project. Are these
          instructions meant for your time zone? Will they survive in this
          climate? Do a bit more research before you commit to planting them in
          the ground.

          You don't care whether you're preaching to the choir. The dogs on the
          other side of the fence would love to get a piece of you, so why egg
          them on? You and I know why: The barking is half the fun, isn't it?
