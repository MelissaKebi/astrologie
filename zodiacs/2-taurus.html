          Taurus is a fixed, feminine earth sign ruled by Venus and associated
          with the Second House of money and value. As a fixed sign, Taurus is a
          natural stabilizer, graced with an earthy presence and stamina. The
          subdued, yet elegantly feminine, nature of Taurus is sensualized by
          its planetary ruler, Venus. Taurus is always counted on for great
          taste and pleasurable pastimes. But the phrase, “stubborn as a bull,”
          fits this zodiac sign beautifully, as it is represented by the Bull.
          However, nobody can deny Taurus' ability to weather any storm through
          thick and thin.

          It would pay to look at things extra closely today. That 'vitamin
          water' you'll drink during the day actually contains as much sugar and
          calories as a can of soda. No wonder it gives you an energy boost. Why
          waste money on something bogus when the real thing is only a spigot
          away.

          You've had hardwood floors your whole life, but a visit to a friend's
          house may have you looking at carpet in a whole new light. Don't let
          yourself fall into one camp or another -- keep your options open when
          it comes to home decor, allowing decorative choices to give you a new
          perspective.

          You could charm your way out of a paper bag most days, but you just
          can't find your way out of this one. Why isn't it working? Are these
          people from a completely different culture than your human? No, that's
          not it. Say hello to the vet or the groomer.

          You have a way with people, and today it's strongest with those who
          don't know you well. That doesn't mean people are wising up -- just
          that you are a great host or hostess to outsiders!

          them.
