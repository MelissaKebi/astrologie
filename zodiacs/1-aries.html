        <p>
          Aries is a cardinal, masculine fire sign. It's ruled by Mars and is
          associated with the First House of “the self.” As a cardinal sign,
          Aries begins the zodiacal modality and astrological year. It's the
          original leader! Aries's masculine nature is forthright with vigor, a
          trait further amplified by its planetary ruler, Mars. Aries is known
          to be vivacious, enthusiastic, childish, and a bit selfish. Although
          this sign is impulsive and hotheaded, nobody can deny the
          quick-thinking and intense call-to-action innate in any Aries.
          Expressed as the Ram, Aries can be counted on to headbutt its way
          through anything!

          You don't play your cards close enough to your chest. In fact, you may
          be a bit too frank and open for some. Some humans, that is. If they
          don't like your approach, save it for the dog park.
