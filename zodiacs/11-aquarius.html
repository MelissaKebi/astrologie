        <p>
          Aquarius is a fixed, masculine air signâ€”ruled by Saturn and Uranus.
          It's associated with the Eleventh House of greater communities,
          friendships, and dreams. Aquarius is a paradox. Its fixed nature is
          unmoving, yet its air qualities prefer innovation. Aquarius is a
          technological sign, preferring both the structure of Saturn and the
          unconventionality of rebellious Uranus. To amplify Aquarius'
          quirkiness, it's represented as the Water-Bearer. Surprisingly,
          Aquarius is highly empathetic, but shielded by a cold front. Aquarius
          wants to better the collective but is also highly selective with
          personal relationships. No matter what, Aquarius tends to shine in its
          individualism.

          On busy days like this it's easy to mindlessly snack on junk or not
          eat at all. Be prepared by packing a healthy lunch. Chicken breast or
          tuna on whole grain bread is easy to make and nutritious. Oh, and
          don't forget some fruit for that mid-afternoon sugar rush.

          After reading the back of a package of seeds, you may be even more
          confused than when you started your gardening project. Are these
          instructions meant for your time zone? Will they survive in this
          climate? Do a bit more research before you commit to planting them in
          the ground.

          You don't care whether you're preaching to the choir. The dogs on the
          other side of the fence would love to get a piece of you, so why egg
          them on? You and I know why: The barking is half the fun, isn't it?
