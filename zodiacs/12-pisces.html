        <p>
          Pisces is a mutable, feminine water sign, co-ruled by Jupiter and
          Neptune. It's associated with the Twelfth House of the subconscious,
          hidden talents/weaknesses, and self-undoing. Pisces weaves in and out
          of conscious reality thanks to its mystical mutability. Graced with
          water attributes, Pisces has this eclectic magic, gifted with psychic
          receptivity and scarily accurate intuition. Jupiter tends to magnify
          these qualities, but Neptune also tends to delude them with a dreamy
          confusion. Represented by two Fish swimming in synchronicity, Pisces
          is the reminder to consider the known and unknown.

          On busy days like this it's easy to mindlessly snack on junk or not
          eat at all. Be prepared by packing a healthy lunch. Chicken breast or
          tuna on whole grain bread is easy to make and nutritious. Oh, and
          don't forget some fruit for that mid-afternoon sugar rush.

          After reading the back of a package of seeds, you may be even more
          confused than when you started your gardening project. Are these
          instructions meant for your time zone? Will they survive in this
          climate? Do a bit more research before you commit to planting them in
          the ground.

          You don't care whether you're preaching to the choir. The dogs on the
          other side of the fence would love to get a piece of you, so why egg
          them on? You and I know why: The barking is half the fun, isn't it?
